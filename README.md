# 📖 HR Smart Advisor: Multi-Agent RAG System

A sophisticated AI-driven advisory system specialized in Saudi Arabian Human Resources laws and regulations. The system utilizes a **Multi-Agent Architecture** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to provide accurate, cited, and audited answers from internal documents (PDFs) and live web sources.

## 🚀 Technical Stack

This project is built using a modern AI stack designed for production-grade observability and performance:

* **Core Engine:** Python 3.10+
* **LLM Orchestration:** Gemini 2.0 Flash via OpenRouter/LiteLLM
* **Agent Framework:** Custom **ReAct** (Reasoning + Acting) implementation with full observability
* **RAG System:**
* **Embeddings:** `multilingual-e5-base` for high-accuracy Arabic/English semantic search.
* **Processing:** `RecursiveChunker` for intelligent document splitting.


* **Observability:**
* **Tracing:** Step-by-step execution logging.
* **Cost Tracking:** Real-time USD cost calculation per query.
* **Loop Detection:** Advanced prevention of repetitive agent actions.


* **Interface:** Streamlit for an interactive, user-friendly dashboard.

## 🧠 The Agent Pipeline

The system employs a linear "Chain of Thought" involving three specialized agents:

1. **Researcher Agent:**
* **Primary Task:** Fact retrieval.
* **Logic:** Searches the **Internal Knowledge Base** first. If data is missing or incomplete, it is mandated to perform a **Web Search** as a fallback.


2. **Analyst Agent:**
* **Primary Task:** Logical synthesis.
* **Logic:** Interprets raw search results, cross-references articles, and identifies legal patterns or gaps.


3. **Writer Agent:**
* **Primary Task:** Final report generation.
* **Logic:** Formats the analysis into a professional, empathetic Arabic response with clear executive summaries and references.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Environment Setup

Activate your virtual environment and install the required dependencies:

```bash
# Activation (Windows)
.\.venv\Scripts\activate

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### 2. Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the `project_starter` directory:

```env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here # or any api Key
MODEL_NAME=openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001 or any model 

```

### 3. Running the Application

**Via CLI:**

```bash
python -m src.main "What are the employee rights for sick leave?"

```

**Via Streamlit (Web UI):**

```bash
streamlit run src/app.py

```

## 🔍 Key Features

* **Zero-Hallucination Guard:** Agents are strictly instructed to use provided tools and cite sources (File names or URLs) for every factual claim.
* **Production Observability:** Every query generates a unique `trace_id` allowing developers to debug the exact reasoning path taken by the AI.
* **Bilingual Support:** Optimized for Saudi Labor Law in Arabic, while maintaining the ability to process English queries.
* **Automatic Ingestion:** Simply drop PDF files into `src/documents/`, and the system will automatically index them into the RAG engine upon startup.
